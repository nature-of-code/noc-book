We’re at the end of our story.   This is the last “official” chapter of this book (though I envision additional supplemental material for the web site and perhaps other new chapters in the future).    We began with inanimate objects living in a world of forces and gave those objects desires, autonomy, and the ability to take action according to a system of rules.  Next, we allowed those objects to live in a population and evolve over time.  Now we ask: What is each object’s decision-making process?  How can it adjust its choices by learning over time?  Can a computational entity process its environment and generate a decision?

// We could add variables for only Confetti here
class Confetti extends Particle {

  Confetti(PVector l) { // check it
  	// Or do something else here.
    super(l);

    [inline]// One more things...

    int x = 0;

    // This line of code is bold
    location.add(velocity); // [bold]

    // This line of code is strike-through
    location.add(velocity); // [line-through]

    // This line of code is regular
    location.add(velocity);
