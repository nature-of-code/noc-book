<p>This book is all about looking at the world around us and coming up with clever ways to simulate that world with code. Divided into three parts, the book will start by looking at basic physics—how an apple falls from a tree, a pendulum swings in the air, the earth revolves around the sun, etc. Absolutely everything contained within the first five chapters of this book requires the use of the most basic building block for programming motion—the <strong><em>vector</em></strong>. And so this is where we begin our story.</p>

<a data-primary="Euclid" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="Euclidean vector" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="geometric vector" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="defined" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Now, the word vector can mean a lot of different things. Vector is the name of a New Wave rock band formed in Sacramento, CA in the early 1980s. It’s the name of a breakfast cereal manufactured by Kellogg’s Canada. In the field of epidemiology, a vector is used to describe an organism that transmits infection from one host to another. In the C++ programming language, a vector (std::vector) is an implementation of a dynamically resizable array data structure. While all these definitions are interesting, they’re not what we’re looking for. What we want is called a <strong><em>Euclidean vector</em></strong> (named for the Greek mathematician Euclid and also known as a geometric vector). When you see the term “vector” in this book, you can assume it refers to a Euclidean vector, defined as <em>an entity that has both magnitude and direction</em>.</p>

<a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="notation" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>A vector is typically drawn as a arrow; the direction is indicated by where the arrow is pointing, and the magnitude by the length of the arrow itself.</p>

<p>In the above illustration, the vector is drawn as an arrow from point A to point B and serves as an instruction for how to travel from A to B.</p>

<h2>1.1 Vectors, You Complete Me</h2>

<a data-primary="bouncing ball sketch" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="bouncing ball sketch" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Before we dive into more of the details about vectors, let’s look at a basic Processing example that demonstrates why we should care about vectors in the first place. If you’ve read any of the introductory Processing textbooks or taken a class on programming with Processing (and hopefully you’ve done one of these things to help prepare you for this book), you probably, at one point or another, learned how to write a simple bouncing ball sketch.</p>

<figure class="screenshot" data-pde="processingjs/chapter01/_1_1_bouncingball_novectors/_1_1_bouncingball_novectors.pde"><img alt="" src="chapter01/ch01_ex01.png" />
<figcaption>If you are reading this book as a PDF or in print, then you will only see screenshots of the code.  Motion, of course, is a key element of our discussion, so to the extent possible, the static screenshots will include trails to give a sense of the behavior. For more about how to draw trails, see the code examples available for download.</figcaption>

<div data-type="example"><h5>Example 1.1: Bouncing ball with no vectors</h5></div>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Variables for position and speed of ball.
float x = 100;
float y = 100;
float xspeed = 1;
float yspeed = 3.3;

//{!4} Remember how Processing works?  setup() is executed once when the sketch starts and draw() loops forever and ever (until you quit).
void setup() {
  size(640,360);
  background(255);
}

void draw() {
  background(255);

  // Move the ball according to its speed.
  x = x + xspeed;
  y = y + yspeed;

  //{!6} Check for bouncing.
  if ((x &gt; width) || (x &lt; 0)) {
    xspeed = xspeed * -1;
  }
  if ((y &gt; height) || (y &lt; 0)) {
    yspeed = yspeed * -1;
  }

  stroke(0);
  fill(175);
  //{!1} Display the ball at the position (x,y).
  ellipse(x,y,16,16);
}</pre>

<p>In the above example, we have a very simple world—a blank canvas with a circular shape (a “ball”) traveling around. This ball has some properties, which are represented in the code as variables.</p>

<div data-type="note">
<dl>
	<dt>position</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>x and y</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Speed</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>xspeed and yspeed</em></p>
	</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>In a more advanced sketch, we could imagine having many more variables:</p>

<div data-type="note">
<dl>
	<dt>Acceleration</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>xacceleration and yacceleration</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Target position</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>xtarget and ytarget</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Wind</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>xwind and ywind</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>Friction</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>xfriction and yfriction</em></p>
	</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>It’s becoming clearer that for every concept in this world (wind, position, acceleration, etc.), we’ll need two variables. And this is only a two-dimensional world. In a 3D world, we’ll need <span class="var">x</span>, <span class="var">y</span>, <span class="var">z</span>, <span class="var">xspeed</span>, <span class="var">yspeed</span>, <span class="var">zspeed</span>, and so on.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t it be nice if we could simplify our code and use fewer variables?</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
float x;
float y;
float xspeed;
float yspeed;</pre>

<p>We could simply have&hellip;</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
Vector position;
Vector speed;</pre>

<p>Taking this first step in using vectors won’t allow us to do anything new. Just adding vectors won’t magically make your Processing sketches simulate physics. However, they will simplify your code and provide a set of functions for common mathematical operations that happen over and over and over again while programming motion.</p>

<p>As an introduction to vectors, we’re going to live in two dimensions for quite some time (at least until we get through the first several chapters). All of these examples can be fairly easily extended to three dimensions (and the class we will use—<span class="klass">PVector</span><code>—</code>allows for three dimensions.) However, it’s easier to start with just two.</p>

<h2>1.2 Vectors for Processing Programmers</h2>

<a data-primary="Processing" data-secondary="vectors and" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="PVector class (Processing)" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="Processing and" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>One way to think of a vector is the difference between two points. Consider how you might go about providing instructions to walk from one point to another.</p>

<p>Here are some vectors and possible translations:</p>

<figure id="chapter01_figure2"><img alt="Figure 1.2" src="chapter01/ch01_02.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.2</figcaption>
</figure>

<div data-type="note">
<dl>
	<dt>(-15, 3)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>Walk fifteen steps west; turn and walk three steps north.</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>(3, 4)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>Walk three steps east; turn and walk four steps north.</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>(2, -1)</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>Walk two steps east; turn and walk one step south.</em></p>
	</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>You’ve probably done this before when programming motion. For every frame of animation (i.e. a single cycle through Processing’s <span class="function">draw()</span> loop), you instruct each object on the screen to move a certain number of pixels horizontally and a certain number of pixels vertically.</p>

<figure id="chapter01_figure3"><img alt="Figure 1.3" src="chapter01/ch01_03.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.3</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For every frame:</p>

<p><strong><em>new position = velocity applied to current position</em></strong></p>

<a data-primary="positions" data-secondary="as vectors" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="positions and" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="velocity and" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="velocity" data-secondary="as vector" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>If velocity is a vector (the difference between two points), what is position? Is it a vector too? Technically, one might argue that position is not a vector, since it’s not describing how to move from one point to another—it’s simply describing a singular point in space.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, another way to describe a position is the path taken from the origin to reach that position. Hence, a position can be the vector representing the difference between position and origin.</p>

<figure id="chapter01_figure4"><img alt="Figure 1.4" src="chapter01/ch01_04.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.4</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let’s examine the underlying data for both position and velocity. In the bouncing ball example, we had the following:</p>

<div data-type="note">
<dl>
	<dt>position</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>x,y</em></p>
	</dd>
	<dt>velocity</dt>
	<dd>
	<p><em>xspeed,yspeed</em></p>
	</dd>
</dl>
</div>

<p>Notice how we are storing the same data for both—two floating point numbers, an <span class="var">x</span> and a <span class="var">y</span>. If we were to write a vector class ourselves, we’d start with something rather basic:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class PVector {

  float x;
  float y;

  PVector(float x_, float y_) {
    x = x_;
    y = y_;
  }

}</pre>

<p>At its core, a <span class="klass">PVector</span> is just a convenient way to store two values (or three, as we’ll see in 3D examples).</p>

<p>And so this &hellip;</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
float x = 100;
float y = 100;
float xspeed = 1;
float yspeed = 3.3;</pre>

<p>becomes &hellip;</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
PVector position = new PVector(100,100);
PVector velocity = new PVector(1,3.3);</pre>

<a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="motion" data-tertiary="implementing with" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Now that we have two vector objects (position and velocity), we’re ready to implement the algorithm for motion—<strong><em>position = position + velocity</em></strong>. In Example 1.1, without vectors, we had:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Add each speed to each position.
x = x + xspeed;
y = y + yspeed;</pre>

<p>In an ideal world, we would be able to rewrite the above as:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Add the velocity vector to the position vector.
position = position + velocity;</pre>

<a data-primary="addition operator" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>However, in Processing, the addition operator + is reserved for primitive values (integers, floats, etc.) only. Processing doesn’t know how to add two <span class="klass">PVector</span> objects together any more than it knows how to add two <span class="klass">PFont</span> objects or <span class="klass">PImage</span> objects. Fortunately for us, the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class includes functions for common mathematical operations.</p>

<h2>1.3 Vector Addition</h2>

<a data-primary="add() function (PVector class)" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="adding" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Before we continue looking at the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class and its <span class="function">add()</span> method (purely for the sake of learning since it’s already implemented for us in Processing itself), let’s examine vector addition using the notation found in math and physics textbooks.</p>

<a data-primary="scalar notation" data-secondary="vs. vector notation" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vector notation" data-secondary="vs. scalar notation" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Vectors are typically written either in boldface type or with an arrow on top. For the purposes of this book, to distinguish a <strong><em>vector</em></strong> from a <strong><em>scalar</em></strong> (<em>scalar</em> refers to a single value, such as an integer or a floating point number), we’ll use the arrow notation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Vector: <span data-type="equation">\vec{v}</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scalar: <span data-type="equation">{x}</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say I have the following two vectors:</p>

<figure id="chapter01_figure5"><img alt="Figure 1.5" src="chapter01/ch01_05.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.5</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Each vector has two components, an <span class="var">x</span> and a <span class="var">y</span>. To add two vectors together, we simply add both <span class="var">x</span><code>’</code>s and both <span class="var">y</span><code>’</code>s.</p>

<figure id="chapter01_figure6"><img alt="Figure 1.6" src="chapter01/ch01_06.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.6</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In other words:</p>

<div data-type="equation">\vec{w} = \vec{u} + \vec{v}</div>

<p>can be written as:</p>

<p><span data-type="equation">w_x = u_x - v_x</span><br />
   <span data-type="equation">w_y = u_y - v_y</span></p>

<p>Then, replacing <span class="var">u</span> and <span class="var">v</span> with their values from Figure 1.6, we get:</p>

<p><span data-type="equation">w_x = 5 + 3</span><br />
   <span data-type="equation">w_y = 2 + 4</span></p>

<p>which means that:</p>

<p><span data-type="equation">w_x = 8</span><br />
   <span data-type="equation">w_y = 6</span></p>

<p>Finally, we write that as a vector:</p>

<div data-type="equation">\vec{w} = (8,6)</div>

<a data-primary="add() function (PVector class)" data-secondary="implementation of" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Now that we understand how to add two vectors together, we can look at how addition is implemented in the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class itself. Let’s write a function called <span class="function">add()</span> that takes another <span class="klass">PVector</span> object as its argument.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class PVector {

  float x;
  float y;

  PVector(float x_, float y_) {
    x = x_;
    y = y_;
  }

  //{!4 .bold} New! A function to add another PVector to this PVector.  Simply add the <em>x</em> components and the <em>y</em>; components together.
  void add(PVector v) {
    y = y + v.y;
    x = x + v.x;
  }
}</pre>

<a data-primary="bouncing ball sketch" data-secondary="implementing with vectors" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Now that we see how <span class="function">add()</span> is written inside of <span class="klass">PVector</span>, we can return to our bouncing ball example with its <strong><em>position + velocity</em></strong> algorithm and implement vector addition:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!1 .line-through}Add the current velocity to the position.
position = position + velocity;
position.add(velocity);</pre>

<p>And here we are, ready to rewrite the bouncing ball example using <span class="klass">PVector</span>.</p>

<a data-primary="dot syntax" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="object-oriented programming" data-secondary="dot syntax" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<div data-type="example"><h5>Example 1.2: Bouncing ball with PVectors!</h5></div>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{!2 .bold} Instead of a bunch of floats, we now just have two PVector variables.
PVector position;
PVector velocity;

void setup() {
  size(640,360);
  //{!2 .bold .no-comment}
  position = new PVector(100, 100);
  velocity = new PVector(2.5, 5);
}

void draw() {
  background(255);
  //{!1 .bold .no-comment}
  position.add(velocity);

  //{!6 .bold} We still sometimes need to refer to the individual components of a PVector and can do so using the dot syntax: position.x, velocity.y, etc.
  if ((position.x &gt; width) || (position.x &lt; 0)) {
    velocity.x = velocity.x * -1;
  }
  if ((position.y &gt; height) || (position.y &lt; 0)) {
    velocity.y = velocity.y * -1;
  }

  stroke(0);
  fill(175);
  ellipse(position.x, position.y, 16, 16);
}</pre>

<p>Now, you might feel somewhat disappointed. After all, this may initially appear to have made the code more complicated than the original version. While this is a perfectly reasonable and valid critique, it’s important to understand that we haven’t fully realized the power of programming with vectors just yet. Looking at a simple bouncing ball and only implementing vector addition is just the first step. As we move forward into a more complex world of multiple objects and multiple <strong><em>forces</em></strong> (which we’ll introduce in Chapter 2), the benefits of <span class="klass">PVector</span> will become more apparent.</p>

<p>We should, however, note an important aspect of the above transition to programming with vectors. Even though we are using <span class="klass">PVector</span> objects to describe two values—the <span class="var">x</span> and <span class="var">y</span> of position and the <span class="var">x</span> and <span class="var">y</span> of velocity—we still often need to refer to the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> components of each <span class="klass">PVector</span> individually. When we go to draw an object in Processing, there’s no means for us to say:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
//{.line-through .no-comment}
ellipse(position, 16, 16);</pre>

<p>The <span class="function">ellipse()</span> function does not allow for a <span class="klass">PVector</span> as an argument. An ellipse can only be drawn with two scalar values, an <span class="var">x</span>-coordinate and a <span class="var">y</span>-coordinate. And so we must dig into the <span class="klass">PVector</span> object and pull out the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> components using object-oriented dot syntax.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
ellipse(position.x, position.y, 16, 16);</pre>

<p>The same issue arises when testing if the circle has reached the edge of the window, and we need to access the individual components of both vectors: <span class="var">position</span> and <span class="var">velocity</span>.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
if ((position.x &gt; width) || (position.x &lt; 0)) {
  velocity.x = velocity.x * -1;
}</pre>

<p>Moving on to multiplication, we have to think a little bit differently. When we talk about multiplying a vector, what we typically mean is <strong><em>scaling</em></strong> a vector. If we wanted to scale a vector to twice its size or one-third of its size (leaving its direction the same), we would say: “Multiply the vector by 2” or “Multiply the vector by 1/3.” Note that we are multiplying a vector by a scalar, a single number, not another vector.</p>

<p>To scale a vector, we multiply each component (<span class="var">x</span> and <span class="var">y</span>) by a scalar.</p>

<figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter01_figure8"><img alt="Figure 1.8: Scaling a vector" src="chapter01/ch01_08.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.8: Scaling a vector&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>

<div data-type="equation">\vec{w} = \vec{u} * n</div>

<p>can be written as:</p>

<p><span data-type="equation">w_x = u_x * n</span><br />
   <span data-type="equation">w_y = u_y * n</span></p>

<p>Let’s look at an example with vector notation.</p>

<p><span data-type="equation">\vec{u} = (-3,7)</span><br />
   <span data-type="equation">{n} = 3</span></p>

<p><span data-type="equation">\vec{w} = \vec{u} * n</span><br />
   <span data-type="equation">w_x = -3 * 3</span><br />
   <span data-type="equation">w_y = 7 * 3</span></p>

<div data-type="equation">\vec{w} = (-9,21)</div>

<p>Therefore, the function inside the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class is written as:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
void mult(float n) {
   //{!2} With multiplication, the components of the vector are multiplied by a number.
   x = x * n;
   y = y * n;
 }</pre>

<p>And implementing multiplication in code is as simple as:</p>

<a data-primary="mult() function (PVector class)" data-secondary="implementation" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
PVector u = new PVector(-3, 7);
// This PVector is now three times the size and is equal to (-9,21).
u.mult(3);</pre>

<h2>1.5 Vector Magnitude</h2>

I know the components (<span class="var">x</span> and <span class="var">y</span>), but how long (in pixels) is the actual arrow?” Understanding how to calculate the length (also known as <strong><em>magnitude</em></strong>) of a vector is incredibly useful and important.</p>

<p>Notice in the above diagram how the vector, drawn as an arrow and two components (<span class="var">x</span> and <span class="var">y</span>), creates a right triangle. The sides are the components and the hypotenuse is the arrow itself. We’re very lucky to have this right triangle, because once upon a time, a Greek mathematician named Pythagoras discovered a lovely formula to describe the relationship between the sides and hypotenuse of a right triangle.</p>

<h2>1.6 Normalizing Vectors</h2>

<p>Calculating the magnitude of a vector is only the beginning. The magnitude function opens the door to many possibilities, the first of which is <strong><em>normalization</em></strong>. Normalizing refers to the process of making something “standard” or, well, “normal.” In the case of vectors, let’s assume for the moment that a standard vector has a length of 1. To normalize a vector, therefore, is to take a vector of any length and, keeping it pointing in the same direction, change its length to 1, turning it into what is called a <strong><em>unit vector</em></strong>.</p>

<figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter01_figure12"><img alt="Figure 1.12" src="chapter01/ch01_12.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.12</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Since it describes a vector’s direction without regard to its length, it’s useful to have the unit vector readily accessible. We’ll see this come in handy once we start to work with forces in Chapter 2.</p>

<p>For any given vector <span data-type="equation">\vec{u}</span>
, its unit vector (written as <span data-type="equation">\hat{u}</span>) is calculated as follows:</p>

<div data-type="equation">\hat{u} = \frac{\vec{u}}{||\vec{u}||}</div>

<p>In other words, to normalize a vector, simply divide each component by its magnitude. This is pretty intuitive. Say a vector is of length 5. Well, 5 divided by 5 is 1. So, looking at our right triangle, we then need to scale the hypotenuse down by dividing by 5. In that process the sides shrink, divided by 5 as well.</p>

<p>In the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class, we therefore write our normalization function as follows:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
void normalize() {
  float m = mag();
  div(m);
}</pre>

<p>Of course, there’s one small issue. What if the magnitude of the vector is 0? We can’t divide by 0! Some quick error checking will fix that right up:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
void normalize() {
 float m = mag();
 if (m != 0) {
   div(m);
 }
}</pre>

<h2>1.7 Vector Motion: Velocity</h2>

<a data-primary="motion" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="vectors" data-secondary="velocity and" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="velocity" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>All this vector math stuff sounds like something we should know about, but why? How will it actually help us write code? The truth of the matter is that we need to have some patience. It will take some time before the awesomeness of using the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class fully comes to light. This is actually a common occurrence when first learning a new data structure. For example, when you first learn about an array, it might seem like much more work to use an array than to just have several variables stand for multiple things. But that plan quickly breaks down when you need a hundred, or a thousand, or ten thousand things. The same can be true for <span class="klass">PVector</span>. What might seem like more work now will pay off later, and pay off quite nicely. And you don’t have to wait too long, as your reward will come in the next chapter.</p>

<p>For now, however, we want to focus on simplicity. What does it mean to program motion using vectors? We’ve seen the beginning of this in <a href="#chapter01_example2">Example 1.2</a><code>:</code> the bouncing ball. An object on screen has a position (where it is at any given moment) as well as a velocity (instructions for how it should move from one moment to the next). Velocity is added to position:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
position.add(velocity);</pre>

<p>And then we draw the object at that position:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
ellipse(position.x,position.y,16,16);</pre>

<p>This is Motion 101.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong><em>Add velocity to position</em></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong><em>Draw object at position</em></strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<a data-primary="Processing" data-secondary="OOP online tutorial" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>In the bouncing ball example, all of this code happened in Processing’s main tab, within <span class="function">setup()</span> and <span class="function">draw()</span>. What we want to do now is move towards encapsulating all of the logic for motion inside of a <strong><em>class</em></strong>. This way, we can create a foundation for programming moving objects in Processing. In <a href="#intro_section2">section I.2 of the introduction</a>, “The Random Walker Class,” we briefly reviewed the basics of object-oriented-programming (“OOP”). Beyond that short introduction, this book assumes experience with objects and classes in Processing. If you need a refresher, I encourage you to check out the <a href="http://processing.org/learning/objects/">Processing objects tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>In this case, we’re going to create a generic <span class="klass">Mover</span> class that will describe a thing moving around the screen. And so we must consider the following two questions:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><strong><em>What data does a mover have?</em></strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong><em>What functionality does a mover have?</em></strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Our Motion 101 algorithm tells us the answers to these questions. A <span class="klass">Mover</span> object has two pieces of data: <span class="var">position</span> and <span class="var">velocity</span>, which are both <span class="klass">PVector</span> objects.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Mover {

  PVector position;
  PVector velocity;</pre>

<p>Its functionality is just about as simple. The <span class="klass">Mover</span> needs to move and it needs to be seen. We’ll implement these needs as functions named <span class="function">update()</span> and <span class="function">display()</span>. We’ll put all of our motion logic code in <span class="function">update()</span> and draw the object in <span class="function">display()</span>.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  void update() {
    //{!1} The Mover moves.
    position.add(velocity);
  }

  void display() {
    stroke(0);
    fill(175);
    //{!1} The Mover is displayed.
    ellipse(position.x, position.y, 16, 16);
  }

}</pre>

<a data-primary="class (Processing)" data-secondary="constructor" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="constructor" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>We’ve forgotten one crucial item, however: the object’s <strong><em>constructor</em></strong>. The constructor is a special function inside of a class that creates the instance of the object itself. It is where you give instructions on how to set up the object. It always has the same name as the class and is called by invoking the <strong><em>new</em></strong> operator:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  Mover m = new Mover();</pre>

<p>In our case, let’s arbitrarily decide to initialize our <span class="klass">Mover</span> object by giving it a random position and a random velocity.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  Mover() {
    position = new PVector(random(width), random(height));
    velocity = new PVector(random(-2,2), random(-2,2));
  }</pre>

<p>If object-oriented programming is at all new to you, one aspect here may seem a bit confusing. After all, we spent the beginning of this chapter discussing the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class. The <span class="klass">PVector</span> class is the template for making the <span class="klass">position</span> object and the <span class="klass">velocity</span> object. So what are they doing inside of yet another object, the <span class="klass">Mover</span> object? In fact, this is just about the most normal thing ever. An object is simply something that holds data (and functionality). That data can be numbers (integers, floats, etc.) or other objects! We’ll see this over and over again in this book. For example, in <a href="#chapter04_section1">Chapter 4</a> we’ll write a class to describe a system of particles. That <span class="klass">ParticleSystem</span> object will have as its data a list of <span class="klass">Particle</span> objects&hellip;and each <span class="klass">Particle</span> object will have as its data several <span class="klass">PVector</span> objects!</p>

<p>Let’s finish off the <span class="klass">Mover</span> class by incorporating a function to determine what the object should do when it reaches the edge of the window. For now let’s do something simple, and just have it wrap around the edges.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  void checkEdges() {
    //{!11} When it reaches one edge, set position to the other.
    if (position.x &gt; width) {
      position.x = 0;
    } else if (position.x &lt; 0) {
      position.x = width;
    }

    if (position.y &gt; height) {
      position.y = 0;
    } else if (position.y &lt; 0) {
      position.y = height;
    }
  }</pre>

<p>Now that the <span class="klass">Mover</span> class is finished, we can look at what we need to do in our main program. We first declare a <span class="klass">Mover</span> object:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
Mover mover;</pre>

<p>Then create and initialize the mover in <span class="function">setup()</span>:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
mover = new Mover();</pre>

<p>and call the appropriate functions in <span class="function">draw()</span>:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
mover.update();
mover.checkEdges();
mover.display();</pre>

<h2>1.8 Vector Motion: Acceleration</h2>

<p>OK. At this point, we should feel comfortable with two things: (1) what a <span class="klass">PVector</span> is and (2) how we use <span class="klass">PVector</span><code>s</code> inside of an object to keep track of its position and movement. This is an excellent first step and deserves a mild round of applause. Before standing ovations and screaming fans, however, we need to make one more, somewhat bigger step forward. After all, watching the Motion 101 example is fairly boring—the circle never speeds up, never slows down, and never turns. For more interesting motion, for motion that appears in the real world around us, we need to add one more <span class="klass">PVector</span> to our class—<span class="var">acceleration</span>.</p>

<p>The strict definition of <strong><em>acceleration</em></strong> we’re using here is: <em>the rate of change of velocity</em>. Let’s think about that definition for a moment. Is this a new concept? Not really. Velocity is defined as <em>the rate of change of position</em>. In essence, we are developing a “trickle-down” effect. Acceleration affects velocity, which in turn affects position (for some brief foreshadowing, this point will become even more crucial in the next chapter, when we see how forces affect acceleration, which affects velocity, which affects position). In code, this reads:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
velocity.add(acceleration);
position.add(velocity);</pre>

<p>As an exercise, from this point forward, let’s make a rule for ourselves. Let’s write every example in the rest of this book without ever touching the value of velocity and position (except to initialize them). In other words, our goal now for programming motion is: Come up with an algorithm for how we calculate acceleration and let the trickle-down effect work its magic. (In truth, you’ll find reasons to break this rule, but it’s important to illustrate the principles behind our motion algorithm.) And so we need to come up with some ways to calculate acceleration:</p>

<h3>Acceleration Algorithms!</h3>

<a data-primary="acceleration" data-secondary="algorithms for" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="acceleration algorithms" data-type="indexterm"></a>

	<li>
	<p><em>A constant acceleration</em></p>

	<li>
	<p><em>A totally random acceleration</em></p>
	</li>

	<p><em>Acceleration towards the mouse</em></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<a data-primary="acceleration algorithms" data-secondary="constant" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Algorithm #1, <em>a constant acceleration</em>, is not particularly interesting, but it is the simplest and will help us begin incorporating acceleration into our code. The first thing we need to do is add another <span class="klass">PVector</span> to the <span class="klass">Mover</span> class:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
class Mover {

  PVector position;
  PVector velocity;
  //{.bold} A new PVector for acceleration
  PVector acceleration;</pre>

<p>And incorporate acceleration into the <span class="function">update()</span> function:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
 void update() {
    //{!2 .bold} Our motion algorithm is now two lines of code!
    velocity.add(acceleration);
    position.add(velocity);
 }</pre>

<p>We’re almost done. The only missing piece is initialization in the constructor.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  Mover() {</pre>

<p>Let’s start the <span class="klass">Mover</span> object in the middle of the window&hellip;</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    position = new PVector(width/2,height/2);</pre>

<p>&hellip;with an initial velocity of zero.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    velocity = new PVector(0,0);</pre>

<p>This means that when the sketch starts, the object is at rest. We don’t have to worry about velocity anymore, as we are controlling the object’s motion entirely with acceleration. Speaking of which, according to Algorithm #1, our first sketch involves constant acceleration. So let’s pick a value.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
    acceleration = new PVector(-0.001, 0.01);
  }</pre>

<p>Maybe you’re thinking, “Gosh, those values seem awfully small!” That’s right, they are quite tiny. It’s important to realize that our acceleration values (measured in pixels) accumulate over time in the velocity, about thirty times per second depending on our sketch’s frame rate. And so to keep the magnitude of the velocity vector within a reasonable range, our acceleration values should remain quite small. We can also help this cause by incorporating the <span class="klass">PVector</span> function <span class="function">limit()</span>.</p>

<a data-primary="limit() function (PVector class)" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="magnitude (of vectors)" data-secondary="limiting" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="PVector class (Processing)" data-secondary="limit() function" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="velocity" data-secondary="limiting" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// The limit() function constrains the magnitude of a vector.
velocity.limit(10);</pre>

<p>This translates to the following:</p>

<p><em>What is the magnitude of velocity? If it’s less than 10, no worries; just leave it as is. If it’s more than 10, however, reduce it to 10!</em></p>

<p>Now on to Algorithm #2, <em>a totally random acceleration</em>. In this case, instead of initializing acceleration in the object’s constructor, we want to pick a new acceleration each cycle, i.e. each time <span class="function">update()</span> is called.</p>

<figure class="screenshot" data-pde="processingjs/chapter01/_1_9_motion101_acceleration/_1_9_motion101_acceleration.pde processingjs/chapter01/_1_9_motion101_acceleration/Mover.pde"><img alt="ch01 ex09" src="chapter01/ch01_ex09.png" />

<p>Because the random vector is a normalized one, we can try scaling it:</p>

<h2>1.9 Static vs. Non-Static Functions</h2>

<a data-primary="functions" data-secondary="static vs. non-static" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="methods" data-secondary="static vs. non-static" data-type="indexterm"></a> <a data-primary="Processing" data-secondary="static vs. non-static methods" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Before we get to Algorithm #3 (<em>accelerate towards the mouse</em>), we need to cover one more rather important aspect of working with vectors and the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class: the difference between using <strong><em>static</em></strong> methods and <strong><em>non-static</em></strong> methods.</p>

<p>Forgetting about vectors for a moment, take a look at the following code:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
float x = 0;
float y = 5;

x = x + y;</pre>

<p>Pretty simple, right? <span class="var">x</span> has the value of 0, we add <span class="var">y</span> to it, and now <span class="var">x</span> is equal to 5. We could write the corresponding code pretty easily based on what we’ve learned about <span class="klass">PVector</span>.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
PVector v = new PVector(0, 0);
PVector u = new PVector(4, 5);
v.add(u);</pre>

<p>The vector <span class="var">v</span> has the value of (0,0), we add <span class="var">u</span> to it, and now <span class="var">v</span> is equal to (4,5). Easy, right?</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at another example of some simple floating point math:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
float x = 0;
float y = 5;

float z = x + y;</pre>

<p><span class="var">x</span> has the value of 0, we add <span class="var">y</span> to it, and store the result in a new variable <span class="var">z</span>. The value of <span class="var">x</span> does not change in this example (neither does <span class="var">y</span>)! This may seem like a trivial point, and one that is quite intuitive when it comes to mathematical operations with floats. However, it’s not so obvious with mathematical operations in <span class="klass">PVector</span>. Let’s try to write the code based on what we know so far.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
PVector v = new PVector(0,0);
PVector u = new PVector(4,5);
//{.line-through} Don’t be fooled; this is incorrect!!!
PVector w = v.add(u);</pre>

<p>The above might seem like a good guess, but it’s just not the way the <span class="klass">PVector</span> class works. If we look at the definition of <span class="function">add()</span> . . .</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
void add(PVector v) {
    x = x + v.x;
    y = y + v.y;
 }</pre>

<p>we see that this code does not accomplish our goal. First, it does not return a new <span class="klass">PVector</span> (the return type is “void”) and second, it changes the value of the <span class="klass">PVector</span> upon which it is called. In order to add two <span class="klass">PVector</span> objects together and return the result as a new <span class="klass">PVector</span>, we must use the static <span class="function">add()</span> function.</p>

<a data-primary="static functions" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<p>Functions that we call from the class name itself (rather than from a speciﬁc object instance) are known as <strong><em>static functions</em></strong>. Here are two examples of function calls that assume two <span class="klass">PVector</span> objects, <span class="var">v</span> and <span class="var">u</span>:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
// Static: called from the class name.
PVector.add(v, u);

// Not static: called from an object instance.
v.add(u);</pre>

<p>Since you can’t write static functions yourself in Processing, you might not have encountered them before. <span class="klass">PVector</span>'s static functions allow us to perform generic mathematical operations on <span class="klass">PVector</span> objects without having to adjust the value of one of the input <span class="klass">PVector</span><code>s</code>. Let’s look at how we might write the static version of <span class="function">add()</span>:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
  //{!1} The static version of add allows us to add two PVectors together and assign the result to a new PVector while leaving the original PVectors (v and u above) intact.
  static PVector add(PVector v1, PVector v2) {
    PVector v3 = new PVector(v1.x + v2.x, v1.y + v2.y);
    return v3;
  }</pre>

<p>There are several differences here:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The function is labeled as <strong><em>static</em></strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The function does not have a <strong><em>void</em></strong> return type, but rather returns a <span class="klass">PVector</span>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The function creates a new <span class="klass">PVector</span> (<span class="var">v3</span>) and returns the sum of the components of <span class="var">v1</span> and <span class="var">v2</span> in that new <span class="klass">PVector</span>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>When you call a static function, instead of referencing an actual object instance, you simply reference the name of the class itself.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
PVector v = new PVector(0, 0);
PVector u = new PVector(4, 5);
//{.line-through .no-comment}
PVector w = v.add(u);
//{.bold .no-comment}
PVector w = PVector.add(v, u);</pre>

<p>The <span class="klass">PVector</span> class has static versions of <span class="function">add()</span>, <span class="function">sub()</span>, <span class="function">mult()</span>, and <span class="function">div()</span>.</p>

<h2>1.10 Interactivity with Acceleration</h2>

<a data-primary="acceleration algorithms" data-secondary="interactive" data-type="indexterm"></a>

<figcaption>Figure 1.14</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To finish out this chapter, let’s try something a bit more complex and a great deal more useful. We’ll dynamically calculate an object’s acceleration according to a rule stated in Algorithm #3 — <em>the object accelerates towards the mouse</em>.</p>

<p>Anytime we want to calculate a vector based on a rule or a formula, we need to compute two things: <strong><em>magnitude</em></strong> and <strong><em>direction</em></strong>. Let’s start with direction. We know the acceleration vector should point from the object’s position towards the mouse position. Let’s say the object is located at the point (<span class="var">x</span>,<span class="var">y</span>) and the mouse at (<span class="var">mouseX</span>,<span class="var">mouseY</span>).</p>

<figure class="half-width-right" id="chapter01_figure15"><img alt="Figure 1.15" src="chapter01/ch01_15.png" />
<figcaption>Figure 1.15</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Figure 1.15, we see that we can get a vector (<span class="var">dx</span>,<span class="var">dy</span>) by subtracting the object’s position from the mouse’s position.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span class="formula">dx = mouseX - x</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span class="formula">dy = mouseY - y</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s rewrite the above using <span class="klass">PVector</span> syntax. Assuming we are in the <span class="klass">Mover</span> class and thus have access to the object’s <span class="klass">PVector position</span>, we then have:</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
PVector mouse = new PVector(mouseX,mouseY);
// Look! We’re using the static reference to sub() because we want a new PVector pointing from one point to another.
PVector dir = PVector.sub(mouse, position);</pre>

<p>We now have a <span class="klass">PVector</span> that points from the mover’s position all the way to the mouse. If the object were to actually accelerate using that vector, it would appear instantaneously at the mouse position. This does not make for good animation, of course, and what we want to do now is decide how quickly that object should accelerate toward the mouse.</p>

<p>In order to set the magnitude (whatever it may be) of our acceleration <span class="klass">PVector</span>, we must first <em>_</em> that direction vector. That’s right, you said it. <em>Normalize</em>. If we can shrink the vector down to its unit vector (of length one) then we have a vector that tells us the direction and can easily be scaled to any value. One multiplied by anything equals anything.</p>

<pre data-code-language="java" data-type="programlisting" class="codesplit">
float anything = ?????
dir.normalize();
dir.mult(anything);</pre>

<p>To summarize, we take the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Calculate a vector that points from the object to the target position (mouse)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Normalize that vector (reducing its length to 1)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scale that vector to an appropriate value (by multiplying it by some value)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Assign that vector to acceleration</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>And here are those steps in the <span class="function">update()</span> function itself:</p>

<p>You may be wondering why the circle doesn’t stop when it reaches the target. It’s important to note that the object moving has no knowledge about trying to stop at a destination; it only knows where the destination is and tries to go there as quickly as possible. Going as quickly as possible means it will inevitably overshoot the position and have to turn around, again going as quickly as possible towards the destination, overshooting it again, and so on and so forth. Stay tuned; in later chapters we’ll learn how to program an object to <strong><em>arrive</em></strong> at a position (slow down on approach).</p>

<p>This example is remarkably close to the concept of gravitational attraction (in which the object is attracted to the mouse position). Gravitational attraction will be covered in more detail in the next chapter. However, one thing missing here is that the strength of gravity (magnitude of acceleration) is inversely proportional to distance. This means that the closer the object is to the mouse, the faster it accelerates.</p>

<p><em>As mentioned in the preface, one way to use this book is to build a single project over the course of reading it, incorporating elements from each chapter one step at a time. We’ll follow the development of an example project throughout this book—a simulation of an ecosystem. Imagine a population of computational creatures swimming around a digital pond, interacting with each other according to various rules.</em></p>

<p>Step 1 Exercise:</p>

<p>Develop a set of rules for simulating the real-world behavior of a creature, such as a nervous fly, swimming fish, hopping bunny, slithering snake, etc. Can you control the object’s motion by only manipulating the acceleration? Try to give the creature a personality through its behavior (rather than through its visual design).</p>
