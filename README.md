# The Nature of Code book project

Hello.  If you found your way here you have found the raw source material for my Nature of Code book.  The book is not yet for sale, but will be soon in PDF and print forms at [natureofcode.com](http://www.natureofcode.com).  There, you'll also find a free version of the book available as HTML.  

You may notice that all of the book's content is here -- illustrations, source code, raw text (ASCIIDOC files), and well as design elements (CSS).  The book is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/).  You are free to share and remix the book, as long as you provide attribution and do not attempt to re-sell.

All of the book's source code is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/LGPL/2.1/) as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

By using GitHub to host all the raw material for the book, it's my hope that I will be able to more easily manage corrections and revisions.  Please use the GitHub issues for bug reports, typos, suggestions, etc.  You are also welcome to fork the repo, make corrections on your own and submit a pull request.

Finally, please note that if you attempt to generate the book using ASCIIDOC, it won't come out properly.  While I am using ASCIIDCOC as the raw material, the book's design (for PDF and HTML) is being generated via something called the "Magic Book Project."  Check out the repo here: https://github.com/runemadsen/Magic-Book-Project.  We're hoping to launch the Magic Book Project soon as a web application.  Currently to use it, you'll have to clone the repo and configure and run manually. There are instructions in the Magic Book's repo.

Stay tuned for more!
