[[asciidoc_101]]
== AsciiDoc 101

http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[AsciiDoc] is a text document
format for writing (among other things) books, ebooks, and documentation. The
main advantages of AsciiDoc are that it is easy to use and plays well with
O'Reilly's publishing tools, including Atlas. It's similar to wiki markup--if
you can write a Wikipedia article, then you'll have no problem with AsciiDoc.
This http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[Asciidoc cheat sheet] covers a lot of
the nitty-gritty, but the following sections will give you an overview of the
markup you'll use most frequently.

You can create and edit AsciiDoc in any text editor, and then add it to Atlas
by either pasting it into the wiki interface or using git. If you're on
Windows, you can use http://notepad-plus-plus.org/[Notepad++] or any other
text editor. If you're on a Mac, you can use TextEdit,
http://macromates.com/[TextMate] (which you can pair with an
https://github.com/zuckschwerdt/asciidoc.tmbundle[AsciiDoc bundle]),
http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/[TextWrangler], or any of a
number of choices. Or maybe you prefer old school vi or Emacs. That's okay,
too. The important thing is that you use the AsciiDoc markup.

This chapter illustrates some of the most common elements used in writing
technical documentation.

[WARNING]
====
If you're viewing this document as a PDF, EPUB, or Mobi, you're seeing the
_output_ from the AsciiDoc source, rather than the AsciiDoc markup itself.
Since this chapter is intended as an introduction to the markup, you should
view the source, available on GitHub.

[[SECTION_ID]]
=== Top-Level Section
This one designates AsciiDoc level 2 (DocBook +<sect1>+).

==== Second-Level Section (Delimited Style) ====
This one designates AsciiDoc level 3 (DocBook +<sect2>+). Also note that you
can have the delimiter on both sides as in this one.

===== Third-Level Section (Delimited Style)
This one designates AsciiDoc level 4 (DocBook +<sect3>+).

[[INLINES]]
=== Inline Elements

Here's some some _italic_, `monospaced` (aka ``constant-width'' or “CW”),
*bold*, *+CW bold+*, ^super^, and ~sub~ text.

Plus signs can also be used for literal (CW) text, for example: +ls -al+

Standard O'Reilly font conventions are as follows:

Italic:: _Ital_ indicates new terms, URLs, email addresses, filenames, and
file extensions.
+Constant width+:: +CW+ is used for program listings, as well
as within paragraphs to refer to program elements such as variable or function
names, databases, data types, environment variables, statements, and keywords.
*+Constant width bold+*:: *+CWB+* shows commands or other text that should be
typed literally by the user.
pass:[<replaceable>Constant width italic</replaceable>]::
pass:[<replaceable>CWI</replaceable>] shows text that should be replaced with
user-supplied values or by values determined by context.

[WARNING]
====
Please do not use AsciiDoc's mechanisms for forcing linebreaks,
page breaks, or "ruler" lines, as these don't mesh with Atlas's book building
tools.
====

[[XREFS]]
=== Cross-References

To generate a cross-reference, use this syntax:

----
<<ID>>
----

where `ID` is the anchor or BlockID of the target, which you place in double
square-brackets above that block.

The Atlas build system will transform this into a standard cross-reference (or
+<xref>+) for you: the rendered text will adjust automatically if you later
move the target or reword its title, and it will work as a hyperlink in online
versions. Any time you refer to another component of your book, please be sure
to use xref markup, not hardcoded text.

<<XREF_TABLE>> shows the standard text generated from xrefs in PDF builds.

[WARNING]

Please do not use AsciiDoc's optional `xreflabel` and `caption` features on
anchors and xrefs, as these interfere with standard generated xref formats.

.What's Going On, Anyway?
****
A general understanding of what is going on under the hood of Atlas will help
you make the most of it. One of the primary appeals of AsciiDoc is that it was
created to export to http://www.docbook.org/[DocBook XML]. In other words, for
each AsciiDoc markup syntax, there is an equivalent DocBook element. When you
build your book (as described in <<building_and_debugging>>), Atlas converts the AsciiDoc to
DocBook and then generates the book formats from that DocBook. This series of
magical transformations is part of what makes writing in Atlas fun, but it
also requires you to use the correct AsciiDoc markup for things to work right.

If you get a build error, the most likely cause is an AsciiDoc markup error.
Atlas provides error message logs to help you troubleshoot and fix syntax
errors. Read more about building and debugging in <<building_and_debugging>>.

==== Admonitions (Notes and Warnings)

Here are some admonitions:

[NOTE]
===============================
O'Reilly books traditionally make no visual distinction between the DocBook
+<note>+, +<tip>+, and +<important>+ elements.
===============================

.Titled Tip
[TIP]
===============================
We do support optional titles in admonitions (in most series).
===============================

.Titled Warning
[WARNING]
===============================
O'Reilly Animal books traditionally make no visual distinction between the
DocBook +<warning>+ and +<caution>+ elements.
===============================

[CAUTION]
===============================
This one is a +<caution>+.
===============================

[[figures_and_other_images]]
==== Figures and Other Images

Somewhere nearby is <<FIG1>> (a figure, titled and cross-referenced). Unlike
other block elements, figures "float" by default. While AsciiDoc permits you
to specify http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/userguide.html#X9[various
image-related attributes] for scaling/alignment/etc., generally these sorts of
adjustments are not necessary. You can, however, prevent a float by adding `float="none"` like so:

----
[[FIG1]]
.A Figure
image::images/tiger.png[float]
----

[[FIG1]]
.A Figure
image::images/tiger.png[]

Or you may prefer an image with no caption, like so:

image::images/screenshot.png[]

==== Lists

===== Labeled (aka Variable or Term-Definition) Lists

Term 1::
  Definition/description
Term 2::
  Something else

===== Bulleted (aka Itemized) Lists

* lions
* tigers
** sabre-toothed
** teapotted
* bears

===== Ordered (aka Numbered) Lists

. Preparation
. Assembly
.. Measure
.. Combine
.. Bake
. Applause

==== Tables

Atlas table styles vary slightly between series are supplied by the template
stylesheets. If your material warrants something other than the default style
as shown in <<STD_TABLE>>, please consult with your editor.

[[STD_TABLE]]
.A Table
[options="header"]
|=======
|P|Q|P^Q
|T|T|T
|T|F|F
|F|T|F
|F|F|F
|=======

==== Code

The AsciiDoc documentation refers to code blocks as "listing" blocks. Here's
one:

----
Hello world!

0        10        20        30        40
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
----

Contrast the code block above with <<EX1>>, which is a _formal_ code example
(titled and cross-referenced).

[[EX1]]
.An Example
====
----
Hello world!

0        10        20        30        40
1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
----
====

[[inline-formatting]]
===== Inline Formatting Within Code

In AsciiDoc, there is no built-in mechanism for inline formatting within code.
If you want to use inline formatting--in particular, for standard O'Reilly
font conventions such as *+<userinput> (CW+bold)+* and _++<replaceable>
(CW+italic)++_ or if you want to include line annotations--you can do so by
using a passthrough block (see <<passthroughs>> for an explanation of passthroughs), like so:

++++
<screen>
hostname $ <userinput>date</userinput>
Sun Apr  1 12:34:56 GMT 1984
</screen>
++++

or this:

++++
<programlisting>
from __future__ import with_statement # This isn't required in Python 2.6
                          <lineannotation>Above is a comment in the code, while this is an "annotation"</lineannotation>
with open("<replaceable>hello.txt</replaceable>") as f:  
    for line in f:        <lineannotation>(note regular italic here vs. constant-width in "hello.txt" on line above)</lineannotation>
        print line</programlisting>
++++

===== Syntax Highlighting

The Atlas book-building toolchain now supports syntax highlighting via
http://pygments.org/[Pygments]. You need only add +[source]+ above each code
block that you want to be syntax-highlighted, and specify the language of the
code. For example, the following code:

....
[source,java]
----
int radius = 40;
float x = 110;
float speed = 0.5;
int direction = 1;
----
....

++++
<?hard-pagebreak?>
++++

will render in the EPUB, PDF, and Mobi (Kindle Fire only) as follows:

[source,java]
----
int radius = 40;
float x = 110;
float speed = 0.5;
int direction = 1;
----

Pygments supports a wide variety of languages that can be used in +[source]+;
see the full list at http://pygments.org/docs/lexers/. Ebook readers that do
not have color screens will still display the highlighting, but in more subtle
shades of gray.

Please note the following caveats:

* Highlighting will not be applied to any code that has inline markup (as
described in <<inline-formatting>>), even if +[source]+ is added above the
code block.

* The color scheme cannot be changed at this time.

* The PDF used for print will contain no highlighting.

===== External Code Files

To include an external code file that is text-only (no markup), use the
+include::+ macro inside of a delimited code block, as shown here:

[source,java]
----
include::code/HelloWorld.java[]
----

To include an external file that contains inline markup (e.g., for callouts,
line annotations, or inline font formatting), skip the code block delimiters
around the +include::+ macro, and instead place passthrough delimiters within
the included file, like so:

include::code/inline_markup.txt[]

===== Code Callouts

http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/AnnotateListing.html#Callouts[Code
callouts] are used to mark specific lines of code with icons keyed to
explanatory text outside the code block. These icon pairs function as
bidirectional links in electronic PDF and downstream formats (i.e., you can
click on the icon in the code to jump to the explanation, and vice versa).

The built-in AsciiDoc mechanism (shown in <<asc_callouts>>) is somewhat more
limited; for one thing, icons are hyperlinked from text to code, but not vice
versa. However, you can always use a passthrough block (see <<passthroughs>>) for full functionality, as shown in <<bidir_callouts>>.

If you have a need to refer to the same bit of explanatory text from more than
one line of code, see <<callout-multiples>> (in <<advanced_asciidoc>>).
